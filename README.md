# steganography-python
This is a steganography app, i.e., it hides some text within an image and can show those hidden texts from such images. I made it using Python and PyLSB Library.

> P.S. I would recommend running this program in a Virtual Environment to avoid the issue of collision between various modules. You can take a look at [this](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-virtual-environment/) article to manage Virtual Environments. 


To run this, you only need to install 2 additional modules, which can be installed using the following command:

`
pip install pyautogui
`
`
pip install tk

`


Now, run the program!

> Note that I have not yet brushed out all the exceptions!
